arithmetic
# Defining variables
a = 12
b = 6

# Arithmetic operations
sum_result = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b
remainder = a % b
exponent = a ** b

# Displaying the results
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
print("Remainder:", remainder)
print("Exponentiation:", exponent)

string
# Defining strings
first_name = "doreen"
last_name = "ann"

# Concatenating strings
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# String operations
name_length = len(full_name)
first_char = full_name[0]
last_char = full_name[-1]

# Displaying the results
print("Full Name:", full_name)
print("Length of Full Name:", name_length)
